## Usage 

To compile the source of a Casestudy, simply type "make" in the
directory containing the source code. All makefiles have been prepared
for RedHat Linux 6.1 (Cartman) on an i386 using the GNU compilers. For
other Unix systems, the Makefile may have to be modified. The random
number generator provided in this distribution was written in C
(ran_uniform.c) for some Casestudies. Some care have to be taken,
because some compilers put underscores after FORTRAN77
subroutines. For example, for SGI machines ran_uniform__ has to be
changed into ran_uniform_ (see Tools/ran_uniform_SGI.c).
